This package is part of my master's thesis on FlipGraphs. It is still unfinished and in active developpment.

## Installation

To install the package, you first need to install [Julia](https://julialang.org). 
After starting Julia, type the following:

```julia-repl
julia> using Pkg 
julia> Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/schto223/FlipGraphs.jl")
```

You can start using the package as follows:

```julia-repl
julia> using FlipGraphs
julia> createDeltaComplex(4,10)
```

You can get help for a function by putting a question mark in front.


## Documentation

For more information on how to use the package, please have a look at the [Documentation](TODO):
