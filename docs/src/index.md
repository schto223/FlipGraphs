# FlipGraphs.jl Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the FlipGraphs.jl package. 
This package was created as part of my master's thesis on triangulations of closed surfaces and the flip graphs thereof.

The aim of the package is to model triangulations on any closed surface and  compute their respective flip graphs.
